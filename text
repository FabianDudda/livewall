analyze your code and ultrathink of a common and robust solution in `livewall-test/page.tsx` file to implement the following behavior:
Give me different solutions and dont start before i give you the go

Current Context:
- The application displays images in a queue/slideshow format
- Images are stored in a database with timestamps (newest to oldest)
- There's currently a transition system that cycles through images
- When new images are uploaded, they need to be inserted into the current display sequence

Required Behavior:
When a new image is uploaded:
1. The new image should be displayed after the current image finishes its display cycle
2. After showing the new image, continue with the remaining images in the original queue order
3. Do not restart the queue from the beginning
4. Make sure that new/old images dont glitch. New images should transition and behave the same as the old

Example Scenario:
- Current queue: [Image A (newest), Image B, Image C, Image D, Image E (oldest)]
- Currently displaying: Image B
- New image X is uploaded
- Expected sequence: Continue showing Image B → Show Image X → Continue with Image C → Image D → Image E

Requirements:
1. Examine the current implementation in `livewall-page/page.tsx`
2. Identify how the image queue and transitions are currently managed
3. Modify the code to insert newly uploaded images into the current position of the queue
4. Ensure the transition timing and user experience remain smooth
