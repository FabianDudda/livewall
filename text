Task: Implement mobile-friendly action buttons for the SimpleImageGallery component using the recommended bottom action bar + three-dot menu approach.

  Requirements:
  1. Desktop behavior: Keep existing hover overlay with action buttons centered
  2. Mobile behavior: Show translucent bottom action bar with primary actions + overflow menu
  3. Touch targets: Ensure all buttons are at least 44px for accessibility
  4. Responsive breakpoint: Use md: (768px) to differentiate mobile from desktop

  Key Changes Needed:

  SimpleImageGallery.tsx modifications:

  1. Add state for mobile menu:
  const [showMobileMenu, setShowMobileMenu] = useState<string | null>(null)

  2. Replace current action buttons section (lines 117-140) with:
  - Desktop: Existing hover overlay behavior
  - Mobile: Bottom gradient bar with primary actions (approve/reject) + three-dot menu for secondary actions (delete)

  3. Add mobile menu modal/dropdown that appears when three-dot button is tapped
  4. Update action button rendering logic to:
  - Show max 2 primary actions in bottom bar on mobile
  - Put remaining actions in overflow menu
  - Use proper touch-friendly sizing (min 44px touch targets)

  Visual Design:
  - Bottom bar: bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60 to-transparent
  - Buttons: White background with rounded corners, proper spacing
  - Three-dot menu: Positioned at bottom-right of action bar
  - Menu modal: Slide up from bottom on mobile, centered overlay on larger screens

  Accessibility:
  - Proper ARIA labels for all buttons
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Focus management for menu interactions
  - Screen reader friendly button descriptions

  Implement this solution while maintaining the existing TypeScript interfaces and props structure. Ensure the solution works with the current getActionButtons callback pattern used in the dashboard.
